            "Two main options were discussed as to the organisation of the collected data.",
            "On the one hand, a bespoke XML structure that connects transcriptions and annotations (down to the word-level) to a common timeline.",
            "Its advantages are that it is easier to read, parse, map onto the Transcriber format and to expand with extra features.",
            "Phone-level analysis can be included in the same structure, or in a separate, linked file.",
            "The respective frame-level representation can be handled by P-files, a technology developed at ICSI, which also comes with a library of tools.",
            "Separation of levels of analysis makes files more compact and manageable.",
            "XML standards offer libraries that can be used for the development of search tools.",
            "On the other hand, the ATLAS (NIST) technology offers a very similar, but more generic organisational scheme based on nodes and links.",
            "These are labeled with domain specific types, like \"utterance\" or \"speaker\".",
            "This option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage (flat XML files or relational database).",
            "In either case, it is important for the chosen format to allow for fast searches, flexible updates and, if possible, be reusable in future work.",
            "In order to confirm the suitability of the data format provided by the ATLAS project, its current state of development will be investigated.",
            "More specifically, the issues that have to be ascertained are, firstly, whether the external file representation offers a format that would be appropriate for speech data, and, secondly, how the linking between the different annotations (eg, between word-level representations and prosodic-feature structures) can be achieved.",
            "Regardless of the actual format, however, there was consensus that keeping levels of analysis (words, phones, frames, etc) on separate, inter-linked files can make their management easier.",
            "Choosing a project-specific format for the representation of the data might not be optimal for future work.",
            "On the other hand, it is not yet clear whether a more standardised, but generic technology, like that of the ATLAS project, can accommodate all the requirements of speech analysis.",
            "Regardless of the particular format, including all annotations (sentences, words, phones, frames, etc) in one file could result in unmanageable file sizes.",
            "Searching, updating or simply parsing a file for a simple task can become an unwieldy process.",
            "Even P-files, which are only for frame-level annotation, may be too verbose for the amount of data resulting from hour-long recordings.",
            "The actual mapping of word-level transcriptions to frame-level representations is expected to be problematic anyway.",
            "Likewise, problems will arise if, in the future, slightly different transcripts of the same data are annotated in formats that do not include time-marks.",
            "Trying to merge such annotations later will not be easy, because of the combination of transcription discrepancies with the loss of the underlying connection offered by the time-marks.",
            "An XML scheme to build representations of the data is already available.",
            "It incorporates information regarding utterances, sentences, speakers, words, etc.",
            "All these features are linked together via time-marks that slot into a single, common timeline.",
            "This format also allows for linking to different levels of representation of the same data.",
            "For the frame-level representation, P-files is a readily available technology, developed at ICSI.",
            "Besides the appropriate format, P-files come with a library of tools and the respective documentation."

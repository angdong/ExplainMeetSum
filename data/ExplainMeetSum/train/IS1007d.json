As for the one with LCD, users could choose the direction and if they pushed on it, it's considered like an enter function. There was also a button which was like a mouse. This prototype had microphone arrays for the speech recognition system and switch for controlling. The remote control needed rechargeable batteries, but the type and the number of batteries were not sure. This prototype cost fifteen dollars and it was high above the budget. The second prototype was basically the same as the first one. However, it used buttons to navigate and enter. This one cost four dollars. The remote control had different modules for different groups of people. The set might use a material like titanium or lithium. User Interface said that features which cost much could be optional so the price could be flexible. Project Manager said that the cost of the whole second plan was below the budget.",

            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the aims, methods, timing, and outsourcing issues concerning transcription of the Meeting Recorder corpus.",
            "The Transcriber software tool was introduced, along with a set of transcription conventions for coding different speech events.",
            "The prospect of sending the data to an external transcription service was weighed against that of hiring a graduate student transcriber pool.",
            "It was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow BMR to maintain greater control over the transcription process.",
            "Methods for distributing the data were briefly discussed, along with an initiative for creating a BMR project website.",
            "The group received an update on the meeting room recording setup and electronics.",
            "The group will obtain a copy of the Corpus of Spoken American English (CSAE) from the LDC to compare the methods and conventions used by UC Santa Barbara with those being considered for the Meeting Recorder project.",
            "Speakers fe008 and me011 will experiment with pre-segmentation procedures in hopes of facilitating the transcription process.",
            "Speaker fe008 will perform the transcription for one meeting (40-60 minutes of data) as a pilot project.",
            "A tentative decision was made to put speaker fe008 in charge of the in-house transcription effort.",
            "Modifications to the Transcriber source code, e.g. adjusting the delay between the audio play function and the inputting of time boundaries, may be undertaken by the BMR group.",
            "An initiative for creating an internal BMR project website was discussed, along with ideas for providing web access to external organizations, such as the University of Washington.",
            "A cabinet will be built to house wires and other electronic equipment used in the recording setup.",
            "A laptop and wireless modem will be avaiable to participants for monitoring the recording progress.",
            "How should transcripts and corresponding audio files be formatted and distributed?",
            "External transcription services are expensive, difficult to monitor, and are unlikely to be able to handle multi-channel data.",
            "It is unclear which levels of transcription should be encoded.",
            "What size of segment is most useful for doing transcriptions?",
            "Which level of segmentation is most suitable for the aims of the project?",
            "Transcriber's interface only allows the user to view two overlapping speakers.",
            "Decisions must be made regarding the security of electronic recording equipment.",
            "Efforts are in progress to collect and transcribe 30-40 hours of Meeting Recorder data.",
            "The Transcriber tool is being used to do word-level transcriptions, and was reported to work well, when used with supplementary scripts, for specifying multiple speakers.",
            "Other levels of transcription being considered include marking stress, repairs, and false starts.",
            "A set of transcription conventions have been formulated for marking colloquial forms, the continuity of utterances, etc.",
            "A cost assessment was made for sending Meeting Recorder data to an external transcription service.",
            "It was agreed that hiring linguistics graduate students would be cheaper and allow the group to maintain greater control over the transcription process.",
            "Tentative pre-segmentation efforts will enable the automatic generation of phrase boundaries and speaker identity coding, and will be extendable for use at UW.",
            "Perl and XWaves scripts are available for extracting and aligning digits data.",
            "Other suggestions for future work included performing multi-channel speech/non-speech detection, and linking an ASR system to the Transcriber tool.",
            "The recording room electronics setup has been diagrammed and will take approximately one week to configure.",
            "It was suggested that such efforts will enable researchers at UW and other collaborating institutions to create their own recording setups more cheaply."

The meeting covered the pipeline they would use to create their data set. The team started by discussing the technical issues with their own recording equipment and then moved onto a general overview of the entire pipeline. Then, the team narrowed down on how they could carry out transcriptions. Various ideas were thrown around, but the team did not seem convinced that a software could do the task. They would need human annotators due to the granularity they were aiming for. Then, the team talked abut transcription conventions; what should be annotated and how? The team also talked about the interface they could use for transcriptions. Finally, the team ended with a discussion on the time it takes to annotate and the electronics involved.",

            "The Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding group discussed plans and concerns regarding the architecture of SmartKom, its proposed modules, and the types of interactions expected to take place between modules.",
            "The meeting was largely focused on SmartKom's decision making capacity and how to adapt this functionality to the tourist information domain.",
            "The group set a date for assessing SmartKom plans.",
            "It was decided that SmartKom's action plans should be represented in XML as a state transition network.",
            "It was proposed that the term 'dialogue planner' should replace 'dialogue manager'.",
            "Prolog will be phased out completely and replaced by Java code.",
            "The dialogue manager must be capable of changing states, i.e. go from being event driven to answering a question from a planning module.",
            "SmartKom should feature a well defined core interface, with domain-specific information kept external.",
            "A syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system.",
            "As a functional module, the action planner is too restrictive for the tourist domain and requires complex slots from the dialogue manager.",
            "What form will the language input have, and what will the action planner do with it?",
            "Links must be in place between the input end, action planner, parser, and language feedback components for communicating the current state of plan.",
            "Interactions in a deep map system between the spatial planner and the route planner are too convoluted.",
            "SmartKom requires a fast and robust parser that includes language-specific extensions.",
            "Which form of semantic construction grammar should be used, and how would such information be derived from the parsed input?",
            "Efforts are in progress to complete and test the code, generate an English grammar like that used in the German system, and get the parser interface working.",
            "A 'wizard of Oz' style data collection experiment is in progress to model users' underlying intentions when communicating with the dialogue component of a tourist domain GPS.",
            "Corresponding interfaces and a belief net will be incorporated into the knowledge modelling module.",
            "While the current focus is on decision making, a fuller implementation of SmartKom will enable it to query the user for desired information.",
            "Stemming information is connected to the lexicon through the use of knowledge bases from Verbmobil."

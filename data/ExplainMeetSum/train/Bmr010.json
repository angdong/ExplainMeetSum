            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group talked about the ongoing transcription effort and issues related to the Transcriber tool, which despite its limitations for capturing tight time markings for overlapping speech, will continue to remain in use.",
            "Speaker mn014 explained his efforts to pre-segment the signal into speech and non-speech portions for facilitating transcriptions.",
            "Recording equipment and procedures were discussed, with a focus on audible breathing and the need for standards in microphone wear and use.",
            "And, finally, it was determined that speaker mn005's efforts to detect speaker overlap using energy should instead be focussed on pitch- and harmonicity-related features or be guided by a non-featural, statistical approach, i.e. via the use of Markov models.",
            "In the interest of time, it was decided that the group should continue using the existing Transcriber tool and perform a forced alignment on the close-talking microphones that will, it is hoped, help to recover some of the time information indicating where different speaker overlaps occurred in the signal.",
            "A meeting will be arranged with NIST to decide on a common standard and format for doing transcriptions.",
            "One or two meetings will be assigned to multiple transcribers to check for inter-annotator agreement.",
            "To cut down on audible breaths during recordings, the group will institute some level of standards for microphone wear and use.",
            "Speaker mn005 will feed his hand-segmented data into the speech segmenter developed by Javier to train it to identify different types of speech (i.e. that of single versus multiple speakers), as well as focussing on pitch- and harmonicity-related features for identifying overlapping speech.",
            "There is no channel identifier to help in encoding speaker overlaps.",
            "Speech uttered while laughing is problematic for ASR.",
            "So far, speaker mn005's attempts to detect speaker overlap have been unsuccessful, as it has not been possible to normalize energy as a reliable indicator of overlap.",
            "Speaker mn014's efforts to detect speech/non-speech portions in the mixed signal (using an HMM-based detector with Gaussian mixtures) have produced pre-segmentations that facilitate the transcription effort.",
            "Speaker mn014 also trained the system to identify speech from loud versus quiet speakers.",
            "Such pre-segmentation modifications allow the experimenter to specify the minimum length of speech and silence portions desired, and also facilitate the identification of pauses and utterance boundaries.",
            "The transcriber pool is making quick progress, and may be used in the future to perform other types of coding, e.g. a more detailed analysis of speaker overlap.",
            "Transcribers are coding non-speech gestures, such as audible breaths and laughter, both of which are useful for improving recognition results.",
            "Recent modifications to the Transcriber tool allow transcribers to listen to speech from different channels, as well as helping to preserve portions of overlapping speech, and enabling the creation of different output files for each channel for a cleaner and more segmentable transcript.",
            "The Praat software package was discussed as an alternative transcription tool capable of representing multiple channels of speech.",
            "Cross-correlation was discussed as a means of enabling speaker identification, and may be integrated into future work."

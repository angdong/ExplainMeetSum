Then three steps of the design process were respectively introduced and explained by Project Manager, and drawings of favourite animals then followed as an imagination-inspiring activity. According to Project Manager, the fifty-million-Euro financial objective of the project would be achieved at a production cost lower than 12.5 Euros and a twofold selling price.

            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer.",
            "Anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora, i.e. Aurora and TI-digits.",
            "The group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of Meeting Recorder digits or Switchboard data.",
            "Pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed.",
            "Finally, speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the SRI recognizer, including conventions for encoding acronyms, numbers, ambient noise, and unidentified inbreaths.",
            "The group decided to delegate the extraction of digits to the transcriber pool.",
            "A tentative decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or Switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features.",
            "Speaker fe008 will run selected Meeting Recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length.",
            "With respect to encoding more fine-grained acoustic information in transcriptions, the question was posed: which features should be marked?",
            "Speaker mn014 reported problems pre-segmenting speech recorded via the lapel microphones.",
            "Normalization of the energy measured across and within channels is problematic when performed for speakers who say little or nothing during meetings.",
            "The evaluation of pre-segmented data is difficult without tightly transcribed time references to the individual channels from which the speech was derived.",
            "The SRI recognizer requires that multi-channel format units not be too large, indicating that some additional pre-processing of unit lengths may be necessary.",
            "A test set of Meeting Recorder digits is nearly complete.",
            "Future work will include training this data on a recognizer, and feeding the recognizer with corresponding far-field microphone data.",
            "It was noted that the results of experiments testing similar digits corpora have yielded high error rates, indicating that similar problems may be expected for the set of Meeting Recoreder digits.",
            "The group discussed the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of digits or Switchboard data.",
            "It was suggested that prior to the use of data-driven methods, knowledge-driven approaches should be used to 'seed' the data with sub-phonemic features, either manually, or using a rich pronunciation dictionary.",
            "A new version of the pre-segmentation tool that segments channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal has been developed and tested.",
            "Future pre-segmentation work will include normalizing other features, such as loudness, enabling the distinction of foreground versus background speech.",
            "Speaker mn014 will also look at cross-correlations for removing false overlaps.",
            "New efforts were reported to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the SRI recognizer, including conventions for encoding acronyms, numbers, ambient noise, and unidentified inbreaths.",
            "With the arrival of the SRI recognizer, 12 hours of forced aligned, recognized data can be expected."

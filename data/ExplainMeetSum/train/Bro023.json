            "They also discusses topics relating to the rules and preferences of the project they are working on, including single vs multiple passes.",
            "A number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group.",

            "Speaker mn007 agreed, at me013's suggestion, to try his noise compensation scheme in compensation with the prior work on spectral subtraction.",
            "In implementing smoothing to the spectral subtraction, latency has been increased; while some feel this is nothing to worry about, others feel it is better to worry now, in case it turns out to be something to worry about.",
            "Speaker me026 has been experimenting with spectral subtraction using different data window sizes.",
            "One possible idea is to use increasing windows as more data becomes available.",
            "Speaker mn049 has been working on Wiener filtering, and testing with just the base system provides 30% improvement.",
            "Using a second stage of filtering led to even more improvement.",
            "Speaker mn007 is working on spectral subtraction, still with minimal results.",
            "Smoothing seems to help, and implementing alongside the neural net should also be positive.",

The team then discussed integrating mean log magnitude spectral subtraction into the SmartKom system. It seemed, however, that lengthening the time for this task was not very effective. The team also learned more about Wiener filtering which worked well when mixed with other approaches. It was almost as effective as the best systems.

So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? And , um {disfmarker} So I w bef before , um {disfmarker} Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was {disfmarker} subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um {disfmarker} So I did that for about three different conditions . And , um {disfmarker} I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se I think {disfmarker} I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds .

Um , and for this I u simply used some code that , uh , {vocalsound} I had from {disfmarker} from Belgium , which is technique that , um , takes a bunch of frame , um , and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy . And then average these minima and take this as an {disfmarker} an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band . And there is something more to this actually .

The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic. But the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials, which made the budget under control. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process.",

The color of the prototype was vanilla and yellow like and the material was a combination of rubber and plastic with a company logo. Moreover, there was a circular design for the numbers so it could be palm-held, accessible from the user' thumb. Besides, a plus button was added on the device so the channels could be switched easily without any confusion.For instance, one plus two it could go to channel twelve. But this function was challenged by Industrial Designer who argued that it was not snappy since the five-second pause input time was enough for switching to the double-digit channel. After all, the team agreed that it was overall, a good design, well representing the company's identity.",

On function wise, the group had a little argument whether to make the product multi-functional or single functional.

They also removed some of the functions being discussed such as LCD screen, teletext and voice recognition, because they wanted to stick with a simplistic design. On design wise, the group finalized on the colour yellow as their product appearance and they chose illuminated buttons as one of their highlights.

            "The Berkely Meeting Recorder group discussed efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap in which the time window analyzed was 200 milliseconds or greater.",

            "Participants discussed alternate strategies for examining energy and the importance of categorizing types of speaker overlap.",

            "Continuing efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap will not include additional log energy analyses, but rather an analysis of raw energy for normalized speaker dataacross windows of varying duration, followed by an examination of pitch- and harmonicity-related features.",
            "Speakers fe008 and fe016 discussed plans to categorize and produce a taxonomy of types of speaker overlap.",

            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed recording equipment and setup issues, recent developments in the transcription effort, other potential types of tagging to be assigned to transcribers, and the post-processing of waveforms.",
            "The discussion was largely focused on efforts to facilitate transcriptions, including the improvement of strategies for transcribing overlapping speech, and achieving greater uniformity in the type of equipment used during recordings and the manner in which recording devices are worn by speakers.",
            "To achieve greater uniformity in across-speaker recording conditions, the group decided to purchase three additional head-mounted microphones.",
            "Future work will include recording more varied meeting data from non-ICSI discussion groups.",
            "It was proposed by speaker fe016 that better communication be established between researchers involved in post-processing of the waveform and ASR.",
            "Use of dissimilar microphones adds an extra, unwanted variable to individual speaker recordings.",
            "Similarly, differences in the type of recording equipment used and the manner in which microphones are worn by speakers causes problems for the transcription effort.",
            "Setting up a microphone array and performing video recordings (in a possible collaboration with NIST) are problematic due to the types of changes in infrastructure they require.",
            "IBM's single-channel approach to transcriptions may pose problems for the post-processing of waveforms and forced alignments, as the group foresees difficulties in referencing chopped segments back to the original times/locations from which they were extracted.",
            "Another post-processing problem involves cross-talk, and, in particular, situations in which a speaker whose contributions to the discussion are relatively sparse but whose microphone picks up signals from the other speakers.",
            "Modifications are being made to multi-trans to enable tight time markings at the boundaries of overlapping speech segments, and facilitate the transcription of such segments.",
            "Pre-segmentation continues to be very beneficial to the transcription effort.",
            "Work by speaker mn014 is in progress to compare the energies of different channels for detecting speech/non-speech portions, facilitating transcriptions,and potentially providing speaker identification information.",
            "Efforts are being developed to create a cross-correlation setup linking recorded data with a map of where individual speakers were seated.",
            "The transcriber pool has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing.",
            "IBM has a team of people employed to transcribe meeting data, and who are transcribing single versus multiple channels.",
            "The group discussed the potential for assigning additional tasks to ICSI's transcriber pool, including tagging more fine-grained acoustic information, and discourse and disfluency tagging."

            "The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel.",
            "He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons.",
            "The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features.",
            "He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost.",

            "The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan.",

            "The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost.",

            "If the budget allows it the remote will include a base unit with a locator function, which will also act as a recharger.",

Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . {vocalsound} Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um , {vocalsound} relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used .

And um {vocalsound} an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So , {vocalsound} what I was thinking {disfmarker} oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh {disfmarker} there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh {disfmarker} yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .",

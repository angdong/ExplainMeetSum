Firstly, groupmates presented on the conceptual specification on components, properties and materials as well as a conceptual specification on user interface design. Also, they suggested conceptual designs including the buttons, the circuit board, the chip to print as well as the LCD screen with backlighting in the device. Then, the group had a discussion on the final remote control concepts. So, they decided to have changeable covers in fruity colours, rechargeable batteries and scroll wheels.

These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .

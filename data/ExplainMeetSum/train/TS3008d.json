The prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the advantages of its main features discussed before and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Lastly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that it was not easy to land on the exact budget. After trying to incorporate as many functions as the team could for a while, the team decided to use regular chips, normal batteries and a combination of cheap materials and fancy ones, which made the budget under control.",

In terms of materials and color, the team designed one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber buttons. Also, the team agreed that the company logo, together with the standard color could be the company's identity.

In terms of the material used on the device, the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic with one small part used in one special materia, like titanium, as well as a special color. Moreover, the teletext was discarded and the docking station was added. As for the infrared LED, although it was originally presented on Marketing's powerpoint, the team agreed that it was not helpful. Later, the team found that regular chips were enough for the scroll-button and only the LCD display required the advanced ones, so again the team came back for the regular chip and cut some costs.

Firstly, the user interface designer gave a presentation on the prototype of the product. They provided the prototypes with a lot of details on the appearances and those details were then further discussed by the group.After that, the marketing expert used a seven-point scale to evaluate the prototype according to the past user requirements and trends analysis. They Cleared some misconceptions and reached a consensus on the targeting group and how they could adapt the product better to suit their needs. Then they discussed the price setting of the product and how many functions needed to be retained or removed. As they were trying very hard to remain the price at twelve and a half Euro, they squabbled over the plus and minus of the functions. In the end, they finalized on the costs and planned a celebration for the closing down of the project.",

Marketing pointed out that customers wanted the remote to be technologically innovative and yet simple to use, and that the current fashion trend was fruits and vegetable patterns. Clearly labelled large buttons with the company logo and colour scheme were also preferred. User Interface followed with the presentation on interface concepts, proposing to have a scroll-down design and a distinctly recognizable demographic for specific buttons. Industrial Designer's presentation on component design provided information for the material needed for the remote, and certain restrictions coming with different options. After User Interface's additional thoughts on voice recognition, the team discussed designs of the energy source, the material, and the user interface concept, deciding on latex covers, the gun-metal grey colour, and blue and yellow touch buttons.",

            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed efforts to train and test the Aurora group's HTK-based recognition system on ICSI's digits corpus.",
            "Members also discussed efforts to produce forced alignments from a selection of Meeting Recorder data.",
            "Performance in both tasks was adversely affected by the manner of recording conditions implemented and difficulties attributing utterances to the appropriate speakers.",
            "While debugging efforts resulted in improved forced alignments, dealing with mixed channel speech and speaker overlap remains a key objective for future work.",
            "The group is additionally focused on a continued ability to feed different features into the recognizer and then train the system accordingly.",
            "For comparing Meeting Recorder digits results, it was decided that the Aurora HTK-based system should be tested on data from the TI digits corpus.",
            "The script for extracting speaker ID information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker.",
            "Subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone (as performed in Switchboard evaluations).",
            "Hand-marked, word-level alignments are needed to reveal speaker boundaries and tune the parameters of the model.",
            "Modifications to the Transcriber tool are required for allowing transcribers to simultaneously view the signal in XWaves and see where words are located in time.",
            "Digits training needs to be performed on a larger data set.",
            "A significant loss in recognition resulted from not having included the type of phone-loop adaptation found in the SRI system.",
            "Recognition performance was worse for digits recorded in closed microphone conditions versus those recorded in a studio (e.g. TI-digits).",
            "A mismatch between the manner in which data were collected and the models used for doing recognition---e.g. bandwidth parameterization and the use of near- versus far-field microphones---was identified.",
            "Too little data per speaker can have a negative effect on VTL estimation.",
            "The PZM channel selected for obtaining digits data was too far away from most of the speakers.",
            "Current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and, barring some isolated words and backchannels, can not cope with overlapping background speech.",
            "Performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments, a problem resulting, in part, from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditionss.",
            "Transcribers occasionally misidentified speakers and omitted backchannels that were more hidden in the mixed signal.",
            "Good recognition performance was achieved with the lapel microphones.",
            "The recognizer performed well on time-aligned segments labelled as 'non-overlap' (i.e. one person talking), while segments labelled as 'overlap' (i.e. multiple speakers talking at the same time) yielded poor results.",
            "Future recognition efforts will include looking at reverberation.",
            "Forced alignment improvements were gained by examining the types of errors generated and making the necessary adjustments.",
            "More accurate alignments were achieved by significantly increasing the pruning value.",
            "Future alignment efforts will include cloning the reject model, and adapting it to both the foreground and background speaker.",
            "Members of the group will also compare Meeting Recorder data with other corpora (e.g. Switchboard) to determine whether speaker overlap is a feature that is more specific to meetings versus other modes of spoken interaction.",
            "A cursory analysis of background speech revealed that backchannels frequently occurred after a question was asked.",
            "Backchannels also featured a high proportion of 'yeahs' and a substantially fewer 'uh-huhs'.",
            "Several group members are preparing Eurospeech submissions.",
            "Speakers fe016 and mn017 are preparing a paper about the 'spurt' format, wherein spurts from individual channels---i.e. continuous speech regions delineated by pauses---will be extracted, merged with alignments from different channels, and time-aligned."

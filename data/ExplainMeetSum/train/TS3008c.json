It led to a following discussion about basic function types as well as the size of their buttons. Next, Marketing's presentation identified the three most important aspects of remote design and expressed the focus on the trend on the elder market. As such, the group started to discuss how to meet the satisfaction of different age markets with the design. After that, Project Manager steered the meeting to further questions, including technical functions, material, color design, buttons functionality, and docking station design.",

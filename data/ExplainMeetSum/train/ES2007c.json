Each kind of energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages. The basic battery costs less, and the kinetic provision of energy could be cooler and fancier. Regarding the design of the case, Industrial Designer claimed that it could be a general fact one, a curved one or a double curved one which is more ergonomic. Concerning the material of the case, Industrial Designer claimed that it could be plastic, latex, rubber, wood or titanium. At last they decided that the control is going to be a double curved rubber case, with rubber push-buttons and basic battery.",

And then they found that the decisions the team had already made on interface didn't match the first two points that Marketing had raised. Then they discussed the Bluetooth function which was turned down and on the kinetic provision of energy. User Interface suggested using squeezable rubber which could be an energy generator. The third point that Marketing raised was easy to use. She suggested that next year's fashion would be fruits and vegetables so the team had the idea of making some buttons into fruit shapes.

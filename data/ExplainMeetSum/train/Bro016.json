            "The main project the group is working on, Aurora, has a number of rules attaches as to what developers can and cannot play with, but this needs to be clarified.",
            "The rules are adhered to in the small community, but make no sense from a broader research perspective.",
            "While writing their report, mn007 and fn002 have noticed some tables contain only partial results, and there are things they do not recall the reasoning behind.",

            "The main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to Eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by IBM.",
            "The results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling.",
            "Additionally, the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the SRI recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used.",
            "Finally, a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed.",
            "All these measurements were based on the sample of available transcripts.",
            "Other features, like prosody, will be studied in the near future.",
            "An FTP directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers.",
            "Regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by IBM, the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them.",
            "Suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription, but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications, as there will be extensive in-house post-processing.",
            "Within this discussion, the rationale behind the coding of the time bins according to the flow of discourse was also explained.",
            "The files made available in the FTP directory will be the original ones (before down-sampling), as these seem to be wanted by other parties.",
            "Moreover, as files may have been modified through different processing, tests will be carried out in order to ensure the generation of beep files in a consistent way.",
            "Also towards this goal, some of the time bins will need to be merged.",
            "On the other hand, the two meetings where time bins have been hand-coded in detail will be used to fine-tune the forced alignments.",
            "Recordings will be sent to IBM for transcription.",
            "Before that, the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech/non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted.",
            "In order to make things easier for the transcribers, breathy channels, which are erroneously marked as speech, will be re-classified correctly with other methods.",
            "All this pre-processing will have to be evaluated first by checking a sample of the output files.",
            "Other issues, like whether and how synthesised speech off a laptop needs be transcribed, will be resolved during the in-house post-processing of the transcriptions.",
            "There is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to Eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded.",
            "As to the content of the paper, the overlap statistics have not been normalised against the number of participants in the conversation, although the dependency is probably going to be a weak one.",
            "Additionally, the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena.",
            "The preparation of files for transcription by IBM is facing some minor difficulties, as some features (hand-coded time boundaries, multiplicity of channels etc) may complicate the generation of beep files.",
            "Besides this, the automatic pre-segmentation has been deemed to be good, but there are still no specific measurements to verify this.",
            "The pre-segmentation tool also classifies synthesised speech used in a recording as \"normal speech\" and assigns a random channel to it.",
            "The transcribers at IBM may not be able to differentiate between the two.",
            "A paper has been submitted to Eurospeech, which also includes a section on new corpora.",
            "The statistics in the paper are based on the transcripts of two meeting and two telephone conversation corpora.",
            "In the first two, the overlapped words vary between 9% and 18%.",
            "The telephone conversation results were in-between and very similar to each other.",
            "On the other hand, the automatic recognition errors affected by overlaps were reduced dramatically by focusing on regions with the foreground speech.",
            "Furthermore, it was shown that after spurts, backchannels, disfluencies and discourse markers, the likelihood of interruption by other speakers was much higher.",
            "Files with the recordings, as well as some experimental data will be available for other researchers in an FTP directory that is being set up.",
            "Parts of the recordings will have to be beeped out by a script that has already been developed.",
            "Finally, EDU meetings already recorded have now been pre-segmented and assigned to the transcribers at ICSI."

And um , so , I 've assigned {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've assigned them to our transcribers and um , so far I 've discussed it with one , with uh {disfmarker} And I had a {pause} about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through {vocalsound} uh EDU - one , at some extent . And it occurred to me that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} basically what we have in this kind of a format is {disfmarker} you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at this other meeting that we were all a at {disfmarker} um , {vocalsound} about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . And um , {vocalsound} in {disfmarker} in a way , by {disfmarker} by having this {disfmarker} this chunk and then the backchannel {vocalsound} after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . And um , {vocalsound} it occurred {pause} to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , um , the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker} the maximal gain , it 's {disfmarker} from the IBM {pause} people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . So it 's basically a whole bunch of words {vocalsound} which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , {comment} but {disfmarker} but what I 'm thinking is that {vocalsound} in the EDU meetings , they tend to be {vocalsound} driven by a couple of dominant speakers . And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} then , when {disfmarker} when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . It seems to me {vocalsound} that {vocalsound} um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time {pause} @ @ {comment} uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be {vocalsound} uh y y y And I 'm not exactly sure how that {disfmarker} how that would work with the {disfmarker} with the backchannels . And , so um {disfmarker} And certainly things that are {vocalsound} intrusions of multiple words , {vocalsound} taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , {vocalsound} that would be hard . So , m my {vocalsound} thought is {pause} i I 'm having this transcriber go through {vocalsound} the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time {nonvocalsound} f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that {vocalsound} these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} and maybe not for the other channels .",

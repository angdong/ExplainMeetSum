            "The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made.",
            "The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release.",
            "The Project Manager will negotiate with production companies and with management to decrease the cost of production.",
            "He will also present the new promotion plan to management.",

The group then discussed using the internet for promotion and ordering and drop-shipping the product to the customer's residence. Finally, the subject moved to product evaluation by putting the prototype on the market and analyzing the feedback. The group discussed whether they should spare time for the redesign process before releasing the product to the market.

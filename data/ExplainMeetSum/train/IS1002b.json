First, User Interface introduced the basic components of the remote control and the cost of them. When discussing the user interface design, the group agreed that the product should be good-looking and branded with their company logo. Industrial Designer thought they should keep the functions simple and basic and aimed at the exterior design. Then, the group talked much about the teletext and whether the controller should be only for TV. When it came to the market positioning, the opinion of User Interface differed from Marketing's - the former tended to keep it simple but the latter thought there should be something special about the product to make it exclusive.",

            "The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept, discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls.",

            "The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes, soft materials and primary colours, and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber.",
            "He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button, and the different chips which could be used.",

            "The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products.",
            "The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board.",

Secondly, Industrial Designer introduced that young people favored soft materials and primary colors, but trendy design on the button and the use of LCD display would increase cost since the budget had always been a big problem. Moreover, the team would aim at the younger market based on the decision of the former meeting and agreed that to make the device more profitable they should sell the product for longer than one year.

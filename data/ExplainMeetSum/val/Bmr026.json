            "Transcription was discussed briefly because Jane was not present, however this appears to be progressing well in parallel with IBM.",
            "Web pages have been set up to show transcription status and to allow participants to approve transcripts.",
            "DARPA demos are progressing well with the back-end indexed to allow front-end filtering, and a potential demo ideas investigated which would use X Waves.",
            "Transcriber is now working for Windows, however live pitch contours may not work in the time available.",
            "Backed-up disk space is now fine, however temporary space is running out fast.",
            "Interim measures are discussed while sysadmin are away.",
            "Improvement has been made in the final version of the PLP, which shows better female performance, and combined with Mel Ceptra offers 1.5% improvement.",
            "Digit performance also improved thanks to training using scripted speech data.",
            "Progress has also been made in SRI alignment for tandem system.",
            "The group note that the annual report needs to be worked on for next week, and it is also suggested to hold recognition meetings separately, however these issues will be discussed in more detail at the next meeting.",
            "Jane will be contacted to see whether transcribers could work on a small amount of SmartKom data, in order to get the project moving.",
            "Details of the transcription status web page will be sent to the group.",
            "Participants will be contacted to approve transcripts or suggest edits, however this depends upon decisions regarding disk space and (un)compression of audio files.",
            "There are disk space problems regarding scratch space, although the group decide that a solution about adding extra drives cannot be resolved without talking to sysadmin.",
            "Until they can be contacted, the group will use the hard drives on each other's machines.",
            "Displaying pitch contours live in Transcriber would be desirable for the demo, however, if the group run out of time, the group note that they could generate this statically using Powerpoint.",
            "The group decide that it may be more beneficial to have separate meetings to discuss recognition, since Jane and Liz are less likely to be interested in this.",
            "They will discuss this with them before going ahead.",
            "Scratch disk space used to store the uncompressed meetings when they are being processed is getting short - the group are using 98%.",
            "Various options are suggested about adding extra drives, externally to their machines, or to the server, but these cannot be resolved until after the relevant sysadmin person returns from a break in 10 days time.",
            "Time is getting tight for some of the demo development, especially a lack of Tcl-TK skills slowing up back-end progress.",
            "Additionally, time constraints may impinge upon the \"live-ness\" of the Transcriber pitch contour demo.",
            "Annual report is due next week, so this will need to be discussed at the next meeting.",
            "The group are still waiting for IBM to return transcripts next week.",
            "This is not holding the group up, since parallel transcription is being used, and new transcribers have been recruited.",
            "The web page detailing transcription status is working and being updated when possible.",
            "Backed-up disk space has been seen as a priority by sysadmin, and the group are now only using 30% of this.",
            "DARPA demos are progressing, with indexing added to the back-end, which will allow the front end to do filtering.",
            "Transcriber has been developed to run on a Windows machine, with further development being undertaken to add a pitch contour display.",
            "There is also the potential for a demo to be developed from X Waves.",
            "The final version of PLP has been tested which shows similar performance as the system with the Mel Ceptra front-end (although performance for males is slightly, but non-significantly better).",
            "Combining the two systems gives a 1.5% improvement in performance.",
            "There has also been some improvement with digits, by training the system on read speech data, rather than training solely on TI digits or TIMIT data.",
            "Progress is being made with SRI system alignment, with label files converted to train the net."

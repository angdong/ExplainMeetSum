Users felt it hard to learn new functions and they zapped a lot. The channel switch was the most popular function while the power, volume and channel selections buttons were very relevant. The market was to be segmented to different groups and most users were between thirty-six and forty-five years old and young users had different tastes about the LCD compared to the old. The speech recognition features were welcomed by the second largest group, the young but which group they should targeted remained to be discussed. Marketing concluded that less important functions should be discarded and the device should be user friendly.",

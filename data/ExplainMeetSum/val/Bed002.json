            "The initial task of the EDU group is to work on inferring intentions through context.",
            "In the navigational paradigm used for the task, these intentions are to \"see\" to \"enter\" or to \"get to the closest point of\" a building.",
            "There will be purpose-designed experiments carried out.",
            "However, the starting point is, through the use of existing data, to determine possible linguistic, discourse or situation features that define intentionality.",
            "These may include the type of building, time of day, particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native.",
            "Initially, these features will be hand-coded, but the goal is to find ways of extracting them automatically from the XML data.",
            "Consequently, they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like JavaBayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated.",
            "A prototype system will be put together to test hypotheses regarding both the exact nature of the features and how intentions are derived from them.",
            "Inferring intentions in a navigational context is an appropriate task both in project and real-world terms.",
            "Its goals are clearly defined and contributre to a smarter system.",
            "Although there are some preliminary data to work on, task-specific experiments and recordings will take place.",
            "The XML format is going to be used has not been defined, although the SmartKom data can be used as a foundation.",
            "In the first instance, the group will have to decide on the software package to be used for the creation and manipulation of the belief-nets.",
            "Stability and ease-of-use -in addition to ability to handle XML- of the package are the focus at this stage, instead of the ability to handle large amounts of data.",
            "Experts in Bayes nets within ICSI can be consulted on the matter.",
            "The decision will be presented in the next meeting along with a first schema of the belief-nets themselves.",
            "Possible intermediate nodes can be added to the nets after this.",
            "The hypothesis that a set of features from which intentions can be derived exists has to be assessed, before moving on to how to extract these features from the data automatically.",
            "Curent navigation systems do not provide for the user's particular intentions when asking for directions.",
            "They always compute the shortest path between source and destination.",
            "The SmartKom parser, for example, does not mark up data with features adequate for the inference of these intentions.",
            "Although it is understandable that language, discourse and situation features will play a role in how they are weighed, the exact nature of those features is unclear.",
            "Also hard to evaluate at this stage, is how the assumed features will combine in a belief-net, in order to provide the conditional probabilities of the users' intentions.",
            "Even if these problems are solved, extracting the features from the data may prove to be a bottleneck.",
            "The existing data are appropriate only for preliminary work, as they don't include intention-related information.",
            "On the other hand, the details of the experiments that will have to be designed to get more appropriate data are not clearcut and are yet to be settled.",
            "When asking for directions, a user of a navigational device may wish to either view, enter or simply approach a building.",
            "This was identified as an initial problem to be tackled through \"deep understanding\"-type inferences.",
            "There is a set of data to start work on from previous work.",
            "Similarly, the SmartKom data-format and an ontology developed for the tourist domain (both in XML-standard formats) can be used as groundwork for defining the features, which indicate the user's intentions.",
            "For the creation and management of the belief-nets necessary for the task, there are readily available packages -such as JavaBayes- and tools that can provide the infrastructure for a prototype system."

So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus .

And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker} That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed . Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um {disfmarker} Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these .

First, the marketing talked about the user requirements based on a market survey and suggested making their new product good-looking and equipped with less buttons and a speech recognition system. Then the user interface designer stressed that they should design nothing but a remote control because their principle was to make users' simple desires into simple actions. Therefore, the proposed concept for design included just a few buttons, a screen with a back light and titanium, which was accepted by the group. Finally, when it came to the working design of the remote control, the industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source, an interface, a processor, some infrared source, different encryption codes for different TVs, and speech recogniser. All these components would be within budget. At the end of the meeting, the group also talked about how to enable the users to find the controller.",

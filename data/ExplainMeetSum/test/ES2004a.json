Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros, considering the 12.5-Euro production cost. The market range would be international and over all age groups. After the financial targets, the team discussed the remote design. Despite the \"one-for-all\" style, the remote was still supposed to be user-friendly. Standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority. The team, therefore, agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu. Silver lightweight plastic was temporarily decided to be the material, for it is easily moulded and cost-saving.",

            "A detailed diagram of the belief-net had already been disseminated.",
            "Its structure was discussed during the meeting.",
            "There are several endpoints (User, Ontology, Discourse etc) with separate EVA (Enter/View/Approach) values.",
            "Details of how different inputs feed into them were discussed at length.",
            "Ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like \"selling\", \"fixing\" and \"exhibiting\", as well as creating a User-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status.",
            "Similarly, a Go-there (towards a building) node can be influenced by things like the user's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things.",
            "The latter are still ill-defined at this stage.",
            "The study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect.",
            "As each node in the tree is the decision point of the combination of its parent nodes, which rules govern this combination is an important issue.",
            "There are several approaches ranging from simply averaging the inputs to using a hidden variable in order to weight them differently depending on context.",
            "If the latter architecture is used, the net could -to an extent- be trained with the data that is currently being collected.",
            "Although this was mainly a brainstorming meeting, some minor tasks were allocated for the near future.",
            "Since the net architecture and possible decision algorithms were discussed, it is necessary to examine how much of this JavaBayes can accommodate and, if not, what modifications would be necessary.",
            "Additionally, the german partners visiting the institute will need to see some results of the new system design.",
            "Finally, the analysis of the linguistic constructions for the current research domain can begin even with limited data, as, at this stage, they need not be very detailed.",
            "The is only a diagrammatic view of how the decision tree for the EVA task looks like.",
            "A lot of the details have been glossed over: the user model can potentially comprise a huge number of factors; a planning \"go-there\" node needs input from several other areas of the net; there are intricate interactions between discourse and the situation model.",
            "Similarly, what discourse properties are of importance and how they influence EVA probabilities is still a mystery.",
            "On a more general note, there is also the question of whether the net should be updated continuously or only when it is needed.",
            "No final decision was taken as to the rules of computation applying in the belief-net.",
            "The more interesting solutions would ideally require training data, and it is still debatable whether the current collection would be appropriate for this particular task.",
            "In any case, how different architectures can be implemented in JavaBayes and what modifications would be necessary for the purposes of this project also need to be investigated.",
            "A simulator of the set of influence links forming the belief-net was created and put up for discussion.",
            "Different sections of the analysis, such as the user model, the ontology and the discourse are represented as a layer of nodes each with its own EVA probabilities.",
            "They form endpoints to which other nodes like Go-there, User_Budget, User_Thrift and Prosody feed into.",
            "The second presentation concerned the set of computational rules that are to be used with the net.",
            "The simple way to decide on the final output is the majority vote (which E, V or A form the majority of the parent nodes' outputs).",
            "This assumes that all inputs are of equal importance.",
            "Alternatively, each input can be weighted in a fixed way.",
            "A third option is to create a hidden variable that makes the decision of which of the inputs is more trusted in a particular situation.",
            "The same variable can potentially also change the weighting of each input."

And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ?

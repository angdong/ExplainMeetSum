            "The system is still buggy and unstable, but it will soon be ready for a demonstration.",
            "This is the first of two working demos required for the project.",
            "Further than that, there are no restrictions on the focus of the research or its possible applications.",
            "For example, issues like spatial descriptions could be investigated.",
            "The variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego/allo-centric and a proximal/distal paradigm.",
            "The latter is also reflected in neuro-physiological data.",
            "From an engineering perspective, the belief-net for the AVE task should be completed within a few weeks.",
            "The majority of the nodes are already there.",
            "This leaves the dependencies between them and the rules of computation to be set.",
            "Since the whole system is going to be re-designed, there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology, as well as what can be re-used from past EML projects.",
            "In parallel, another team is working on formalisation and notation.",
            "Finally, more ideas are expected to come from students and their research.",
            "The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised.",
            "After the demo, the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals, including issues on ontology, deep semantic constructions, execution engines etc.",
            "Moreover, a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built.",
            "Similarly, the construction analyser should be a single, general tool working for both the tourist domain and child language modelling.",
            "The focus for the next meeting will be on the belief-net, of which a working demo should be complete in the next few weeks.",
            "Since there are not enough data, its connections and weights will have to be designed.",
            "Although JavaBayes has been the tool of choice until now, the possibility that Hugin could be a better option should be investigated.",
            "In order to promote the collaboration with EML, the group-ware server there will be updated with all progress being made in the two sites.",
            "A talk on some of the issues will also be organised to take place at DFKI.",
            "The german SmartKom version available on the server does not work.",
            "The english version, although still under development, does work, however, the system is still unstable as -apart from other reasons- it was initially built to work with a touch screen.",
            "De-bugging and cleaning up has to take place before any new modules are added on it.",
            "As regards the belief-net, no connections and dependencies have been built into it.",
            "These will have to be guessed instead of learnt through data, as not enough data is available for such a task.",
            "Finally, it has been noted that the JavaBayes GUI does not satisfy all the presentation requirements for this belief-net and modifying the underlying code would be too time-consuming.",
            "The german SmartKom system has been translated to English up to the speech synthesis level.",
            "The german syntax trees are currently being adapted to English.",
            "These also contribute information to the synthesis module in order to achieve better pronunciation.",
            "The current english version is probably the best working one, since some of the problems with the original system have been corrected.",
            "The design of the belief-net has also progressed significantly: the vast majority of the nodes have been identified and the feasibility of the task from a technical point of view has been confirmed."

            "Also discussed were the details of the continued collaboration with project partner OGI.",
            "Further investigation into the lack of difference using MSG features makes should not be made while they are on their current short time scale for results.",
            "Same goes for anything else that comes up and looks interesting, leave it for just now.",
            "Really should pick which results are looking the best at this stage, and take only them further.",
            "Someone should look closely at the non-TIMIT databases, their Viterbi alignments, and their phoneme strings to see is that is why TIMIT is better.",
            "Need to get OGI's system from them, and get it running like they do, before integrating into it.",
            "It is unclear if the English TIMIT database is providing the best results because English is the best language or TIMIT is the most accurately labelled dataset because it was hand labelled.",
            "The results table was very large and difficult to follow; it was unclear which of the numbers were error or accuracy rate, and straight rates or percentages of the baseline.",
            "There is very limited training data, over only a few conditions.",
            "Test and real data is likely to encompass much more variability.",
            "Speakers mn007 and fn002 have made further progress into the series of experiments they have been running in previous weeks; results were varied.",
            "The main conclusions include that training on task data is good, and the best broad training data is the English TIMIT database.",
            "Other results show that MSG makes little difference, adding MLP improves when trained on task data, decreases figures when not, while using delta generally improves the situation, as does on-line normalization.",

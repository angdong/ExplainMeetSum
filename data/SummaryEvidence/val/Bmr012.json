            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data.",
            "Recognition performance was very good, indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information, e.g. prosody and overlapping speech.",
            "It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance, and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.",
            "The group also discussed recording setup and equipment issues.",
            "A decision was made to purchase an additional head-mounted crown microphone.",
            "A tentative decision was also made to integrate the use of a hand-held wireless microphone to help compensate for the lack of available close-talking microphones.",
            "The collection of Meeting Recorder data is ongoing, and will include meetings by the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding research group and, possibly, an organized discussion by members of the transcriber pool.",
            "Following close-talking microphone recognition procedures, it was decided that data from the far-field microphones (or PZMs) should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.",
            "Speaker mn017 will compare close-talking microphone recognition results with those obtained for downsampled data.",
            "The SRI recognizer will be set up at ICSI to enable researchers to run their own variants.",
            "The group decided to purchase one additional head-mounted crown microphone.",
            "A tentative decision was also made to acquire a hand-held wireless microphone to pass around to additional meeting participants should the installation of more close-talking microphones prove too difficult.",
            "The suggestion of incorporating the use of cross pads during meeting recordings received favorable comments from participants.",
            "It was also tentatively decided to elicit meeting data from members of the transcriber pool discussing the Meeting Recorder corpus.",
            "During recognition procedures, a fixable acoustic glitch was discovered that causes speech channels to become slightly asynchronized.",
            "Poorer recognition performance was yielded for speech recorded via the use of lapel microphones.",
            "Recognition errors were largely due to misrecogniton of the plural -s and out-of-vocabulary items.",
            "The current recording setup is limited in that not all BMR meeting participants have their own close-talking microphone.",
            "A 'no-frills' recognizer, trained on Switchboard acoustic models and both Switchboard and Broadcast News language models, was used to test data for one transcribed meeting.",
            "Despite a glitch affecting the synchronized output of remaining data, recognition results for the first 20 minutes were very positive.",
            "The recognizer was successful in making accurate gender distinctions among speakers.",
            "It is anticipated that subsequent forced alignment procedures will also generate good results, enabling the group to analyze other types of signal information, such as prosody and overlapping speech segments.",
            "Future work will involve getting assessments of forced aligned data from linguists on the accuracy of time marks.",
            "The collection of Meeting Recorder data is ongoing, and will include meetings by the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding research group.",
            "Transcriptions are also ongoing, with nearly 10 hours of Meeting Recorder data transcribed so far.",

            "The discussion concerned the revised semantic specification and the construction formalism.",
            "The different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them.",
            "The notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars.",
            "The encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles, focus, adjectives, nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated.",
            "Similarly, ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top.",
            "On the other hand, the semantic specification structures information in terms of \"scenario\", \"referent\" and \"discourse segment\".",
            "Each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance.",
            "It is, essentially, a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions, as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology.",
            "Among the issues still being defined, mental spaces and context (eg pronoun references) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification.",
            "Work on both of these formalisms will continue with circumscription of the construction space that will be studied in more detail.",
            "Work on construal will use Bayes-nets, which will be fed information from other modules and implement general rules to infer how utterances are construed.",
            "The semantic specification requires some adjustments.",
            "Amongst other things \"cause\" has to be added as another X-schema.",
            "Linguistic hedging will also be encoded as a demarcation of evidentiality or speaker confidence.",
            "Mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues (time, space etc.): creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces.",
            "However, the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well: it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied.",
            "Given the domains currently used (tourist, child language learning), some features, like speaker attitude, are not of equal importance at this stage.",
            "On the other hand, it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now, as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on.",
            "Finally, a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use Bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting.",
            "The construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces.",
            "On their own, constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space, but the semantic nuances are defined by context.",
            "It is not decided at this stage whether the necessary values should be coded within the construction or as part of construal.",
            "Other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device, but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements; as to stress, it may not be useful as a form value, as it shows the focus exponent, but not what the focus is on.",
            "Moving to the semantic specification, the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality, as well as mental spaces and bindings between them.",
            "Additionally, how referring expressions are linked to referents or even how mental spaces affect this linking are still to lay down in detail.",
            "The revised semantic specification and construction formalism are more stable than the previous versions.",
            "In the latter, we find both construction types and meaning types along with formal considerations like verb subcategorisation, or the ones a \"directed motion\" construction would dictate.",
            "Semantic constraints also come into play.",
            "The semantic specification, on the other hand, is split into three levels: \"scenario\" is a list of schemas and bindings between them, which describes the current event in terms of Source-Path-Goal, Container, etc.; \"referent\" is about the entities in the discourse and includes grammatical information and pointers to the ontology; \"discourse segment\" comprises utterance-specific things.",
            "Apart from the presentation, JavaBayes can now run through the modified web page of the project."

            "Until they can be contacted, the group will use the hard drives on each other's machines.",
            "Displaying pitch contours live in Transcriber would be desirable for the demo, however, if the group run out of time, the group note that they could generate this statically using Powerpoint.",

            "Scratch disk space used to store the uncompressed meetings when they are being processed is getting short - the group are using 98%.",
            "Various options are suggested about adding extra drives, externally to their machines, or to the server, but these cannot be resolved until after the relevant sysadmin person returns from a break in 10 days time.",

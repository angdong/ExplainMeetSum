            "This meeting of the Berkley Meeting Recorder group charts the progress of their project and covers ongoing issues as well as some new ones.",
            "The most pressing issue concerns the demos which the group are preparing for the DARPA meeting next month.",
            "Here they discuss the querying and indexing tool which is progressing well albeit with a few front-end issues, and also the transcriber tool.",
            "Transcription is progressing well, with new people hired, and double checking almost complete.",
            "Work is also going on in parallel with IBM.",
            "Additionally, the group have progressed further with data storage issues, with backing-up their data now regarded as a priority, and more disk space required.",
            "Tools for accessing key file information have been developed which should ensure all meeting information is present.",
            "The collection of CrossPad note-taking data will be pursued in future meetings.",
            "Finally, other progress made includes getting the ChannelTrans interface working, ordering more wireless microphones, and analysing recognition runs.",
            "DARPA demo illustrating prosody of meeting events will be completed by the end of the (next) month, so as to allow a week or so for transferring data across to laptops.",
            "After consulting others, the group decide that not backing up their meeting data is a bad idea, since this cannot be recovered.",
            "Therefore, meeting recorder data will be backed up, and also stored manually using the NW archive.",
            "More disk space will be purchased, however for now, data which is easily re-creatable will not be backed up.",
            "After evaluating the use of the CrossPads, the group decide to return one, and also keep one which will be left out in meetings to encourage its use.",
            "Use of PDAs and buttons for note-taking will be investigated, along with using the data for a student research project.",
            "Because of time constraints, the group decide to do simultaneous digits.",
            "Improving the THISL front-end user interface may be difficult if it is to run on Windows as a web server Tcl-TK may need to be used instead.",
            "More information on XML transcription formats is required for the creation of the tools.",
            "Information for key files, such as Microphone type, seating, and participant information, is not being properly recorded, and in some cases the microphones aren't working properly.",
            "However this should be rectified by the use of appropriate XML tools.",
            "The CrossPads have not been used to their full potential, which is because of a number of problems regarding their use:",
            "First, they need to be synchronised with the time of the meeting recording, and secondly, they use a non standard data format which needs converting.",
            "Additionally, some people tend not to make notes in meetings.",
            "Several transcribers have now been hired, and double-checking is almost finished.",
            "Information retrieval will progress using uncorrected transcripts.",
            "In parallel to the transcription, the first five EDU meetings are chunked and ready to go to IBM, once the IBM transcript is checked and satisfactory.",
            "For the DARPA demo:",
            "Tools have been written to convert everything into the correct file formats, an now the THISTL back-end querying and indexing tool is now working on the command line.",
            "Work is also underway to improve the front-end THISTL interface.",
            "The demo of Transcriber interface was discussed, and may include graphical illustration of prosodic features indicating sentence or turn boundaries.",
            "Work is continuing to create tools for handling XML data, which extract data from the XML key files.",
            "Tools will also be provided to ensure that appropriate meeting information is present, and that microphones and recording is working.",
            "The ChannelTrans interface is now working on Windows machines.",
            "More wireless microphones have been ordered, and the room is to be re-wired as suggested by Jane, using the wireless close-talking microphones first, and then the far-field microphones.",
            "Analysis of the recognition runs to identify features and their characteristics is on-going."

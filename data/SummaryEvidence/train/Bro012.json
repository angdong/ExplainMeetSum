            "The Meeting Recorder group at Berkeley met to discuss recent progress.",
            "Of greatest interest was the progress on improving the latency and performance of their recogniser.",
            "There was also concern over overlap of work with partners OGI, and a lack of a good example of room reverberation for demonstrations.",
            "Everyone must be sure and use the high-pass filtering option on the groups software, to deal with irregularities between mics.",
            "In order to coordinate better with OGI, some sort of source code control is required and me018 has offered to investigate, but only minimal progress can be made until after the upcoming deadline for Eurospeech.",
            "When he returns me026 will help.",
            "Also, in two weeks one of the OGI members will return, and meetings should be arranged with him before the next big project meeting.",
            "OGI seem to be having some good results with voice activation detection, so the group need to find out which is the best VAD and start using it.",
            "The is a waveform example of room reverberation on the groups website that was used in a presentation.",
            "It turns out that it is a good example of many things, but not the reverb it is supposed to contain.",
            "Need to find a better example, maybe by just looking at a closer section of waveform.",
            "Minor experimenting found that by dropping the self-loop transition in the HMMs by just 0.1% can increase performance by 10%, but the rules of the task forbid this change.",
            "There is some confusion over what the results produced mean, since it appears they are weighted, which biases improvements in some cases quite heavily.",
            "Speaker me013 is worried that his groups work on spectral subtraction overlaps with that of OGI, and that it may be time better spent on other tasks.",
            "Speaker mn007 and fn002 have been working on improving the recogniser performance as well as reducing it's latency.",
            "Work on new filters has reduced latency, but made no improvement, though a slight reduction in performance occurred in the well matched case.",
            "Also tried adding some spectral subtraction, but it doesn't work will with on-line normalization and at this stage is just hurting results.",
            "They have also been considering the possibility of using a second stream of data looking at the voicedness of the data, which would draw some ideas from previous work.",
            "Me018 has been looking at the baseline system and feels it may be possible to decrease the run time of experiments by decreasing the iteration, and he has also got the five processor Linux machine capable of running HTKs."

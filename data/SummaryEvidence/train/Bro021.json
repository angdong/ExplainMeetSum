            "Other progress was also reported.",
            "A large part of the meeting was spent discussing calculations and approaches using the white-board in the room.",
            "At me013's behest, the group need to look closer at the errors made in tests on the aurora project, because the error rate may not be telling the whole picture.",

            "Some previously reported results from me026 were determined to be garbage due to a bug in the code  Speaker mn052 also feels that his strange results are down to a bug.",
            "This week, speaker mn007 has mostly been focusing on trying different approaches to on-line normalization, but making little impact on results.",
            "He has also been playing with thresholding, effectively adding white noise to the data, but again with minimal affect.",
            "Also making little improvement is fn002's work with Vectorial Taylor series, as a means of dealing with noise.",
            "Mn052 has been adding Wiener filtering to the aurora task, and is thinking about future work on subspace.",
            "Speaker me026 has been investigating phase normalization, and the possibility of adding spectral subtraction to an existing system.",
            "Speaker me006 is still planning some cheating experiments to investigate features for recognition, alongside preparing for his quals.",
            "also, the groups submission to the Eurospeech conference has been accepted."

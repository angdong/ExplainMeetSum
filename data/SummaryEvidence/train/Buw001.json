            "There is also interest in the speech community for fusion of speech with visual data.",
            "Taking some photos of the whiteboard and the positioning of participants is easy enough to do.",

            "Summaries could be used to bootstrap for queries, the exact nature of which remained nebulous.",

            "Within the piloting of data collection ideas, it was decided that CrossPads are going to be used for detection of \"hot points\" during the meeting.",

            "For query generation purposes, all participants will also be asked for their highlight of the meeting.",
            "The general goal regarding the corpus is to investigate the acquisition of further appropriate data through public sources or available collections of other institutions.",
            "As to recordings at ICSI, the group agreed that imposing rules of participation  in order to avoid speaker overlaps was not desirable.",
            "Instead, they will aim for collecting stylistically varied data (different group dynamics and types of meeting).",
            "Further action will also be taken to close other pending issues: the web pages will be organised, the recording room will be finalised and UW will also test their recording infrastructure.",
            "The recording of meetings and any possible additional tasks must be set up in a user-friendly way, otherwise it would be difficult to recruit volunteers.",
            "Asking participants to do more than they normally would in a meeting could put people off.",
            "The video-recording of meetings, apart from adding an extra level of instrumentation complexity, can also make people apprehensive.",
            "The usability and usefulness of CrossPads is not certain.",
            "Acquiring data from other sources will not be straightforward, as they may either not be suitable for this project or not publicly available.",

            "The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group of Berkeley met for the first time in two weeks.",
            "Group members reported their progress in the areas of spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering and noise estimation.",
            "They also discusses topics relating to the rules and preferences of the project they are working on, including single vs multiple passes.",
            "A number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group.",
            "There are hopes that a visitor coming for three weeks, may lead to a longer term collaboration.",
            "The visitor works on spectral subtraction, so speaker me026 will make sure he talks to him.",
            "Speaker mn007 agreed, at me013's suggestion, to try his noise compensation scheme in compensation with the prior work on spectral subtraction.",
            "In implementing smoothing to the spectral subtraction, latency has been increased; while some feel this is nothing to worry about, others feel it is better to worry now, in case it turns out to be something to worry about.",
            "Speaker me026 has been experimenting with spectral subtraction using different data window sizes.",
            "One possible idea is to use increasing windows as more data becomes available.",
            "Speaker mn049 has been working on Wiener filtering, and testing with just the base system provides 30% improvement.",
            "Using a second stage of filtering led to even more improvement.",
            "Speaker mn007 is working on spectral subtraction, still with minimal results.",
            "Smoothing seems to help, and implementing alongside the neural net should also be positive.",
            "He has also been working on noise estimation with an energy minima approach that does not require the voice activity detector."

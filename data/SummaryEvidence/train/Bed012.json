            "The focus of the meeting was on a presentation of the work done already on the building of the Bayes-net.",
            "The input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models, feeds into a set of decision nodes, such as the Enter/View/Approach (EVA) endpoint.",
            "In any particular situation, most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context.",
            "Therefore, they will either have to be pruned a posteriori, or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion.",
            "The latter option could could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms.",
            "In any case, on what basis the \"winner\" output is chosen is not clear.",
            "One suggestion was discussed: the particular constructions used can determine the pertinent decision (output) nodes.",
            "The complete prototype of the Bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting.",
            "After that, it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser, in order to test and link modules together.",
            "The suggestion that the most appropriate decision node of the belief-net in each situation could be chosen as a function of what construction was used, was deemed unsuitable at this stage.",
            "There are many interdependencies between the output nodes that this approach could not take into account.",
            "The rest of the values for the Bayes-net nodes will be built in within the week.",
            "The finished prototype will be presented during the next meeting.",
            "Any set of inputs will provide either the whole range of output values of the Bayes-net or an a priori selection of those outputs.",
            "In both cases, what is needed is a way to single out the appropriate outputs for any given context.",
            "For example, in the case of a \"where is\" question, whether the prevalent output should be \"Go-there\" or \"Info-on\" or even a third option has to be computed somehow.",
            "In any case, there are many input values that have not been entered in the Bayes-net at this stage.",
            "Furthermore, no inputs for the Ontology and Discourse can be built in yet, as they involve research that will be carried out in the future.",
            "Finally, there has been a problem with adding probabilities in a net created with the Hugin software, but this should be overcome very shortly.",
            "The presented Bayes-net takes inputs from the Situation, User, Discourse and Ontology models.",
            "There are several values (elements) defined in each of these models.",
            "The inputs are fed into the belief-net, which, in turn, outputs the posterior probabilities for the values of all the decision nodes.",
            "These comprise \"Go-there\", \"EVA\", \"Info-on\", \"Location\", \"Timing\", etc.",
            "At this stage, all the decision nodes are evenly weighted: regardless of the context, each output is trusted equally.",
            "Input and output node structure was presented in XML, as this is the format that will be used for the system.",
            "A large number of the value probabilities have already been set."

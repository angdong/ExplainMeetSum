            "An alternative representation of the Bayes-net, it depicts context features as classes, and dependencies as relations between them.",
            "The current outputs show the desirability of a site, as well as its EVA mode.",
            "The fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net.",

            "It attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course.",
            "The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation).",
            "Although no detailed linguistic analysis takes place, it was suggested that the use of FrameNet could be a useful approach.",
            "There were also further suggestions for meetings with ICSI researchers.",
            "As the data collection is going into its second phase, more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues.",
            "Subjects can be recruited from within the Psychology department students, since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus.",
            "As the work on creating a PRM for the system has progressed, it is now necessary to find an implementation that can work as a PRM interpreter.",
            "There are no plans to build one from scratch, but it seems that other research groups at Stanford may already have one.",
            "Moreover, closer collaboration with the local PRM group will be pursued with additional participation in their meetings.",
            "An early version of the PRM of the system presented the same problem as a flat Bayes-net: the CPT's become too large.",
            "Another PRM issue that arose and remained unclear was how the probabilities are specified (instead of learnt) on the actual relations between the classes.",
            "Furthermore, the lack of a PRM interpreter is an open issue.",
            "It is not within the remit of the project to build one from scratch, therefore, an existing implementation has to be found.",
            "On the other hand, the discussion about the smart tutoring system being built at the International University showed the importance of finding out  which context parameters are influential in a given domain.",
            "It is easy to hack up a system for a small domain, but making it scalable is much more difficult.",
            "Finally, there was a passing mention of problems encountered with the speech synthesis module of SmartKom.",
            "The first phase of the data collection has been completed.",
            "Thirty subjects were recorded in total.",
            "Of those dialogues, ten have been transcribed.",
            "A new wizard will carry out the second phase.",
            "On top of this, a presentation of a PRM of the proposed system took place.",
            "The PRM comprises a set of classes, such as \"user\", \"site\", \"route\", \"time\" and \"query\" with relations between them.",
            "Another class incorporates a number of attributes (\"money affordability\", \"travel compatibility\" etc) modelling the intermediate nodes of the Bayes-net, as well as references to the other classes in the model.",
            "This model is much cleaner, and it also makes it easier to specify the CPT's.",
            "At this stage, the model makes two decisions (outputs): how much a site fits a user's needs and what the user intention is in EVA terms."

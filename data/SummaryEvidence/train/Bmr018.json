            "The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the preparation of a data sample for IBM, the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers, recognition results for a test set of digits data, and forced alignments.",
            "Participants also talked about Eurospeech 2001 submissions, and exchanged comments on the proceedings of the recently attended Human Language Technologies conference (HLT'01).",
            "Preliminary recognition results were presented for a subset of digits data.",
            "Efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed.",
            "Subsequent manual adjustment of speech and non-speech boundaries will be delegated to the transcriber pool.",
            "A subset of Meeting Recorder data will be prepared (i.e. pre-segmented and manually adjusted) for delivery to IBM.",
            "The Transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays.",
            "Transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal.",
            "Should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone?",
            "The pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances, e.g. backchannels.",
            "The Transcriber interface does not allow the user to quickly switch among visual displays, i.e. multi-channel waveforms.",
            "Forced alignments were problematic for non-digits data due to cross-talk.",
            "This problem was reported to be particularly bad for cross-talk featuring more than one word.",
            "Echo cancellation was considered as a means of improving forced alignments, but was ultimately deemed to be too time-consuming given the dynamic aspect of adapting distances between speakers.",
            "Comparing error rates in terms of the recording device used, i.e. lapel versus wireless microphones, is tedious.",
            "Deleting segments of the recordings is expected to be very time-consuming for transcribers.",
            "More results are needed for generating adequate submissions for Eurospeech'01.",
            "Participants have complained that the head-mounted microphone is uncomfortable.",
            "One meeting recording has been channelized and pre-segmented for delivery to IBM.",
            "A sample of digits data is being prepared for IBM.",
            "Preliminary recognition results were obtained for a subset of digits data.",
            "The error rate distribution was multimodal, reflecting differences in performance for native versus non-native speakers, and also possible pre-processing errors.",
            "Future efforts will involve an attempt to get good forced alignments on digits data and generate a report for Eurospeech'01.",
            "A program has been developed for replacing sections of recorded speech with editing bleeps.",
            "The tightening of time bins for one NSA meeting was checked and judged to be highly accurate.",
            "Efforts are ongoing to improve forced alignments for a subset of non-digits data, including acoustic adaptation manipulations."

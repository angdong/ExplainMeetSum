            "Essentially the cube consists of three dimension: input features;\ntraining corpus; and test corpus.",
            "Most important concerns are which\ncombinations of features to use, and what combinations of languages\nand broad/specific corpora to use for the training",
            "The group will meet at the building at 6am to go to the airport for\ntheir field trip together.",
            "Speaker me018 needs to discuss files that can be moved with speaker\nmn007.",
            "For the OGI meeting they need to take a clear description of the cube\nproject, and an estimate of how long the entire process should take.",
            "At the meeting they should discuss what they will ultimately put\nthrough the system.",
            "People are to consider what me034 could do on the project to speed\nthings up, though creating the phoneme superset is a possibility.",
            "Speaker me018 is to look into the machines that mn007 has been running\ndata on to find out what they are.",
            "Rather than consider level of normalization as a further dimension to\nthe project, whatever OGI finds the best will be used systematically.",
            "Need to use multiple machines and SPERT boards to run processes on\nbecause they take so long.",
            "They will consider looking at articulatory features rather than\nstraight phonemes, though it wouldn't be perfect.",
            "It is not clear what combinations of dimensions, which features,\nshould be run in the cube project.",
            "It is important to know because\nthe processes are going to be large and processor and memory hungry.",
            "To bear in mind is the fact that the cellular industry has an image of\nspeech recognition in that's what they are after.",
            "Must be careful if using a broad training source that is carefully\nhand marked, because it would be unclear which is the reason for\nimprovement.",
            "Memory is of concern, because final product needs to run potentially\none cheaper cell phones, which have limited memory capacity.",
            "OGI doesn't have a phoneme superset ready prepared, for they are\nworking with clusters, which may be good enough for digits, but not\nfor discriminating words.",
            "Speaker mn007 has been preparing the French digit database.",

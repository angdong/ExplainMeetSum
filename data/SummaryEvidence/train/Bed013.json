            "An idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation.",
            "Having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net.",
            "Setting up certain inputs in the Bayes-net would imply certain intentions, which would trigger dialogues.",
            "There is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm.",
            "The focus should be the Bayes-net, to which all other modules interface.",
            "Situation, User, Discourse and Ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions.",
            "Someone asking where the castle is after having asked about the admission fee, indicates that -given that the castle is open to tourists- they want to go there, as opposed to knowing its whereabouts.",
            "It was suggested that they start analysing what the Discourse and Ontology would give as inputs to the Bayes-net by working on simple utterances like \"where is X?\".",
            "With this addition, all input layers of the net would be functioning.",
            "Although this function would be limited, it would allow for the Bayes-net to be tested in its entirety and, henceforth, extended.",
            "The possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further.",
            "Similarly, as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call, the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit.",
            "The Bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation.",
            "In order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net, it was decided to start expanding the Ontology and Discourse nodes by working with a simple construction, like \"where is X?\".",
            "A robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are, as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in.",
            "The idea to create a language generation module for the system, along with the language understanding, was met with interest, although it was made clear that generation is not just the inverse of understanding.",
            "Understanding what a construction entails does not mean the system can use the construction in all appropriate circumstances.",
            "A dialogue producing system would be useful for training the system further, even though the number of input permutations could render the process computationally unwieldy.",
            "Regarding the conference paper, it was noted that at this stage they have not completed any big parts of the system and there is no evaluation.",
            "Similarly, the length of the paper would not allow for presentation of the formalism in detail.",
            "The focus would have to be on cognitive motivations of the research, and not on system design, anyway.",
            "Such motivations also apply to the belief-net: there are various direct or indirect ways to link features of the Ontology or Discourse with specific intentions.",
            "The originating observation behind the whole project is that utterances like \"Where is X?\" are seemingly unambiguous, but, in context, they can acquire much more complex interpretations.",
            "The SmartKom prototype was in need of de-bugging, which is now on its way.",
            "Similarly, the work on XML is going to be finished within a day.",
            "On the other hand, the data recording has started: almost twenty subjects have already taken part and the transcription of the recordings is running in parallel.",
            "Meanwhile a new person, who is also a possible replacement for the wizard's task in the data collection, has been hired."

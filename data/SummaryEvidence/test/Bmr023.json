            "Specifically, the group would like to have transcripts available, which would mean resolving legal issues for data use and on the basis of feedback from IBM get more transcription underway.",
            "Additionally they would also like to have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for then.",

            "Work on the front end continues, with improvements of 3-5% being made.",

            "Legal issues surrounding the approval and signing off of transcripts by participants has proved to be very complicated, and so will be sorted out off line by those involved by July.",

            "Segmentation for the recogniser has been done by hand which the group consider \"cheating\", instead now they want to use Thilo's automatic segmenter.",
            "The classifier segmentation work is going well, but needs more data to improve results since non-native speaker data cannot be used.",
            "For the front-end, so far the group have been using a high number of Gaussians per cluster (64) rather than the ten per cluster used by researchers at CMU, therefore they need to tune their Gaussian system to the feature vector.",

            "Thilo's automatic segmenter is now working, and although it has low precision, this is mediated by the high recall.",
            "The group will send IBM another sample file to check that the beep problems are fixed, and this should take 2-3 weeks.",

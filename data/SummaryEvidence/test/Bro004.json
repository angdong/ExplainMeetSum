            "The meeting was dominated by a discussion of the first results coming\nin.",
            "There have been four types of test, in which the training data\nvaries, and a variety of input features have been tried.",
            "The process\nand results were explained to the group, the implications of the\nresults discussed, and plans for moving forward were made.",
            "There was also discussion of some of the work being conducted by\nresearch partners OGI, including how the two groups should best work\ntogether.",
            "The group also briefly touched upon resource issues.",
            "Speaker mn007 would like to investigate increasing the context of the\nphonemes.",
            "speaker mn013 does agree with mn007s assessment of the\noutcome, and points out the lack of data, but acknowledges that if\nmn007 is interested he will go ahead with it.",
            "Must be careful in choosing which experiments to perform as an\nimportant visitor is coming soon.",
            "Also need to come up with a\nstronger plan for collaboration with OGI.",
            "Must decide what from both\ncan be brought together, and how then can the work be divided.",
            "Someone (implied with gestures in the meeting) must speak to a person\noutside the group with regards to using a multiprocessor Linux machine\nthat is available.",
            "Debugging the process while there are just two\nprocessors bodes well for when they have 8 to multi-thread.",
            "Speaker mn026 volunteers to get some training running under Linux.",
            "It\nis agreed that he should start with the neural net training, then work\non HTK.",
            "Incorrect assumptions were made when considering the on-line\nnormalization for the main task.  members used different values to a\nprevious study, and whilst it was believed not to make a difference,\nit does, so networks are being retrained.",
            "Currently working with noise conditions being the same in training and\ntest data, but there is nothing which matches the noise on the Italian\ntest data.",
            "In fact no other language matches the noise from Aurora\ndata.",
            "Spanish was being used to train for Italian as it was assumed they\nwere the most similar, but that may not be as close a match as\nthought.",
            "OGI have an interesting approach to Voice Activation Detection for\nremoving blocks of silence, that shows good results, but currently the\nword model being used is too poor to make good use of this and no one\nis working on improving it.",

            "Looking at\ndifferent features, under different training conditions.",
            "Moving from\ntraining with task data to broad data increases error rate by 10%, and\nmoving to multiple languages increases a further 20-30%.",
            "PLP with\nJRASTA better than just PLP on mismatched conditions, but slightly\nworse on well matched.",
            "Speaker fn002 is also looking at the HTK training, but does not yet\nhave results.",
            "Speaker mn007 is going to start work on creating broad phonetic\ncategories based on various features, and combine this with original\nfeatures like PLP.",

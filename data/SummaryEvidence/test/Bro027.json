            "The group discussed possible further investigations that arose from these areas, including better linking the two.",

            "The system at it's current stage employs the neural networks and second stream, but the group leader would like the network investigated separately, incase it is hurting performance.",
            "There are worries regarding the need to make adjustments so the new software can handle the group's different feature set.",
            "The system, whilst improved, also has increased latency, and while the limit has not been set, the group need to reduce it.",
